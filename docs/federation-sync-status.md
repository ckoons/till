# Till Federation Sync - Implementation Status

## Phase 1: GitHub Gist Operations ✅ COMPLETED

### Implemented Features:
1. **Gist Creation** (`create_federation_gist`)
   - Creates public gist with site status
   - Uses gh CLI for authentication
   - Returns gist ID for tracking

2. **Gist Updates** (`update_federation_gist`)
   - Updates existing gist with new status
   - Handles JSON escaping properly
   - Uses PATCH method via gh API

3. **Gist Deletion** (`delete_federation_gist`)
   - Removes gist when leaving federation
   - Optional via `--delete-gist` flag
   - Clean removal from GitHub

4. **Status Collection** (`collect_system_status`)
   - Gathers system information (hostname, platform, CPU count)
   - Counts Tekton installations
   - Records timestamps

### Working Commands:
```bash
# Join federation (creates gist)
till federate join --named

# Push status to gist
till federate push

# Pull updates (placeholder for now)
till federate pull

# Full sync (pull + push)
till federate sync

# Leave and delete gist
till federate leave --delete-gist
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ GitHub CLI integration working
- ✅ Gist creation successful
- ✅ Gist updates working
- ✅ Gist deletion working
- ✅ Anonymous member restrictions enforced
- ✅ Status persistence across commands

### Sample Gist Output:
```json
{
  "site_id": "M4-1757964982-6807",
  "hostname": "M4",
  "platform": "darwin",
  "till_version": 1.5,
  "cpu_count": 16,
  "installation_count": 5,
  "uptime": 1757965418,
  "last_sync": 1757965418,
  "trust_level": "named"
}
```

## Phase 2: Menu-of-the-Day 🚧 NEXT

### To Implement:
1. Create GitHub repository structure
2. Fetch daily menu via gh or HTTPS
3. Cache menu locally
4. Parse YAML/JSON directives

### Repository Structure Needed:
```
ckoons/till/
└── federation/
    ├── menu-of-the-day.yaml
    ├── archives/
    │   └── 2025-01-15.yaml
    └── templates/
```

## Phase 3: Directive Processing 📅 PLANNED

### To Implement:
1. Condition evaluator (version checks, platform checks)
2. Action executor (safe command execution)
3. Result reporting back to gist
4. Directive history tracking

## Phase 4: Advanced Features 📅 FUTURE

### Planned:
1. Telemetry collection for trusted members
2. Automatic sync scheduling
3. Federation statistics dashboard
4. Cross-site discovery

## Current Architecture

### Data Flow:
```
till federate join
    ├── Generate site_id
    ├── Get GitHub token (gh CLI)
    ├── Create gist
    └── Save config (~/.till/federation.json)

till federate sync
    ├── Pull (fetch menu-of-the-day)
    │   └── Process directives
    └── Push (update gist)
        ├── Collect status
        └── Update gist content
```

### Security Model:
- **Anonymous**: Read-only, no gist, no token
- **Named**: Has gist, basic status reporting
- **Trusted**: Full telemetry, priority directives

## Testing

### Automated Tests:
```bash
# Run federation gist tests
./tests/test_federation_gist.sh

# Run GitHub integration tests  
./tests/test_gh_integration.sh
```

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# Complete workflow test
till federate leave
till federate join --named
till federate push
till federate sync
gh api gists  # View your gists
till federate leave --delete-gist
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Week 1):
   - [x] Implement gist operations
   - [x] Test with real GitHub API
   - [ ] Create menu-of-the-day repository structure

2. **Soon** (Week 2):
   - [ ] Implement menu fetching
   - [ ] Add YAML parsing
   - [ ] Test directive distribution

3. **Later** (Week 3-4):
   - [ ] Implement condition evaluator
   - [ ] Add action executor with sandboxing
   - [ ] Complete telemetry system

## Known Issues

1. Discovery output appears before federation messages
2. Menu-of-the-day fetching not yet implemented
3. Directive processing not yet implemented

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Can create/update/delete gists via gh
- ✅ Federation state persists globally
- ✅ Trust levels properly enforced
- ⏳ Menu distribution working
- ⏳ Directives execute safely
- ⏳ Telemetry flows to trusted members
